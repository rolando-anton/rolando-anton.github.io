About 20 years ago, I found a text written by Eric Raymond called &amp;quot;How to become a hacker,&amp;quot; and the section that I would like to highlight is the attitude:
World is full of problems waiting to be solved.</description></item><item><title>HOME LAB PART 5: The Ultimate Small Form Factor Server for Home Lab</title><link>https://rolando.anton.sh/blog/2020/09/12/home-lab-part-5-the-ultimate-small-form-factor-server-for-home-lab/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rolando.anton.sh/blog/2020/09/12/home-lab-part-5-the-ultimate-small-form-factor-server-for-home-lab/</guid><description>Introduction Today I'm going to share the result of my experience building my home lab. As mentioned in my previous post as a spoiler, I shrank my setup even more and ended with a Mini ITX system bringing together two worlds: &amp;quot;/r/sffpc/&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;r/homelab/.&amp;quot; Also, as you may guess from the header, I moved my setup from Intel to AMD for the CPU, and this is also my first setup using AMD.</description></item><item><title>Home Lab Part 4: Shrinking/Consolidating Home Lab</title><link>https://rolando.anton.sh/blog/2020/08/15/home-lab-part-4-shrinking/consolidating-home-lab/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rolando.anton.sh/blog/2020/08/15/home-lab-part-4-shrinking/consolidating-home-lab/</guid><description>And before getting into the server upgrade details, I started to consolidate and optimize the space usage of my home lab; all the devices I had in the rack were short-deep appliances, between 9&amp;quot; deep and some of them even less. While researching, I found an interesting fact, pro audio equipment also uses the 1U format, and most of them are short-deep too.
There are many 1U portable cases in the market.</description></item><item><title>Home Lab Part 3: Building the first version of my home lab</title><link>https://rolando.anton.sh/blog/2020/05/15/home-lab-part-3-building-the-first-version-of-my-home-lab/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rolando.anton.sh/blog/2020/05/15/home-lab-part-3-building-the-first-version-of-my-home-lab/</guid><description>Now its time to share the experiences I had while building my home lab. Keep in mind that I began this project back in March 2016. First, I set a group of criteria during the planing of the build of the equipment I wanted to use in the first iteration of my server.
The main ones was:
RAM Capacity: Because the primary use case is to run virtual machines, the number of virtual machines depends directly on the amount of RAM, the 16 GB of RAM I had on my laptop back then wasn't enough.</description></item><item><title>Home Lab Part 2: Skills and resources before build one</title><link>https://rolando.anton.sh/blog/2020/04/11/home-lab-part-2-skills-and-resources-before-build-one/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rolando.anton.sh/blog/2020/04/11/home-lab-part-2-skills-and-resources-before-build-one/</guid><description>To continue with the previous post about home labs before I started to plan and build mine, I would like to recommend a set of topics or skills to learn or improve the knowledge that I consider where very important to have when I started to build my home lab.
Learning Linux If you are in TI or you plan to do it, there is no valid reason not to learn Linux/Unix.</description></item><item><title>Home Lab Part 1: Why build one?</title><link>https://rolando.anton.sh/blog/2020/04/06/home-lab-part-1-why-build-one/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rolando.anton.sh/blog/2020/04/06/home-lab-part-1-why-build-one/</guid><description>So, as I mentioned in the first post of the blog, the homelab topic is going to be frequent in this blog. And I would like to start sharing my experience of why I decided to start a home lab.
There are many ways to gain or maintain knowledge, and it may be theoretical or practical, in the best-case scenario both. I spent many years installing and supporting network security solutions and when I started to work as a Systems Engineer at Fortinet, everything changed, especially the ways I have to develop expertise in topics outside the realm of the product portfolio.</description></item><item><title>hello world</title><link>https://rolando.anton.sh/blog/2020/04/05/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rolando.anton.sh/blog/2020/04/05/hello-world/</guid><description>I couldn't find a better way to start something with the classic &amp;quot;hello world&amp;quot;. The idea of this blog is to communicate, share knowledge and experiences of my everyday interaction with technology. I'm lucky and very grateful to do what I love as a daily job. And during my free time, I like to keep learning and stay current, and for that, I built my home lab, which can be a whole dedicated topic (I'm going to share a lot about this).</description></item></channel></rss>
