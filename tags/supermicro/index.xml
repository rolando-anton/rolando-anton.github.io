As mentioned in my previous post as a spoiler, I shrank my setup even more and ended with a Mini ITX system bringing together two worlds: &amp;ldquo;/r/sffpc/&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;r/homelab/.&amp;rdquo; Also, as you may guess from the header, I moved my setup from an Intel processor to AMD, and this is also my first setup using AMD.</description></item><item><title>Home Lab Part 4: Shrinking/Consolidating Home Lab</title><link>https://rolando.anton.sh/blog/2020/08/15/home-lab-part-4-shrinking/consolidating-home-lab/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rolando.anton.sh/blog/2020/08/15/home-lab-part-4-shrinking/consolidating-home-lab/</guid><description>And before getting into the server upgrade details, I started to consolidate and optimize the space usage of my home lab; all the devices I had in the rack were short-deep appliances, between 9&amp;rdquo; deep and some of them even less. While researching, I found an interesting fact, pro audio equipment also uses the 1U format, and most of them are short-deep too.
There are many 1U portable cases in the market.</description></item><item><title>Home Lab Part 3: Building the first version of my home lab</title><link>https://rolando.anton.sh/blog/2020/05/15/home-lab-part-3-building-the-first-version-of-my-home-lab/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rolando.anton.sh/blog/2020/05/15/home-lab-part-3-building-the-first-version-of-my-home-lab/</guid><description>Now its time to share the experiences I had while building my home lab. Keep in mind that I began this project back in March 2016. First, I set a group of criteria during the planing of the build of the equipment I wanted to use in the first iteration of my server.
The main ones was:
RAM Capacity: Because the primary use case is to run virtual machines, the number of virtual machines depends directly on the amount of RAM, the 16 GB of RAM I had on my laptop back then wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough.</description></item></channel></rss>
