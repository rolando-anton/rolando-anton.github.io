The idea of this blog is to communicate, share knowledge and experiences of my everyday interaction with technology. I'm lucky and very grateful to do what I love as a daily job. And during my free time, I like to keep learning and stay current, and for that, I built my home lab, which can be a whole dedicated topic (I'm going to share a lot about this).</description></item></channel></rss>
