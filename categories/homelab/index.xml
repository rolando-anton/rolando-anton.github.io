While researching, I found an interesting fact, pro audio equipment also uses the 1U format, and most of them are short-deep too.
There are many 1U portable cases in the market.</description></item><item><title>Home Lab Part 3: Building the first version of my home lab</title><link>https://rolando.anton.sh/blog/2020/05/15/home-lab-part-3-building-the-first-version-of-my-home-lab/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rolando.anton.sh/blog/2020/05/15/home-lab-part-3-building-the-first-version-of-my-home-lab/</guid><description>Now its time to share the experiences I had while building my home lab. Keep in mind that I began this project back in March 2016. First, I set a group of criteria during the planing of the build of the equipment I wanted to use in the first iteration of my server.
The main ones was:
RAM Capacity: Because the primary use case is to run virtual machines, the number of virtual machines depends directly on the amount of RAM, the 16 GB of RAM I had on my laptop back then wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough.</description></item><item><title>Home Lab Part 2: Skills and resources before build one</title><link>https://rolando.anton.sh/blog/2020/04/11/home-lab-part-2-skills-and-resources-before-build-one/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rolando.anton.sh/blog/2020/04/11/home-lab-part-2-skills-and-resources-before-build-one/</guid><description>To continue with the previous post about home labs before I started to plan and build mine, I would like to recommend a set of topics or skills to learn or improve the knowledge that I consider where very important to have when I started to build my home lab.
Learning Linux If you are in TI or you plan to do it, there is no valid reason not to learn Linux/Unix.</description></item><item><title>Home Lab Part 1: Why build one?</title><link>https://rolando.anton.sh/blog/2020/04/06/home-lab-part-1-why-build-one/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rolando.anton.sh/blog/2020/04/06/home-lab-part-1-why-build-one/</guid><description>So, as I mentioned in the first post of the blog, the homelab topic is going to be frequent in this blog. And I would like to start sharing my experience of why I decided to start a home lab.
There are many ways to gain or maintain knowledge, and it may be theoretical or practical, in the best-case scenario both. I spent many years installing and supporting network security solutions and when I started to work as a Systems Engineer at Fortinet, everything changed, especially the ways I have to develop expertise in topics outside the realm of the product portfolio.</description></item></channel></rss>
